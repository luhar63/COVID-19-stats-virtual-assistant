2. Send your message to [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) (the natural language understanding platform which makes it easy to design and integrate a conversational user interface) API, running in node server, as a text string
3. Wait fot the response from the `Dialogflow`: it returns the reply text or the audio
4. If audio, then plays the audio otherwise use the `SpeechSynthesis` interface to give it a synthetic voice.
